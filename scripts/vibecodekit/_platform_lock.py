"""Cross-platform advisory file locking helper.

Uses ``fcntl.flock`` on POSIX and ``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows.  If neither
is available (extremely rare), degrades gracefully to a NO-OP lock — callers
should assume "best-effort single-process" semantics in that case.

Usage::

    from vibecodekit._platform_lock import file_lock

    with file_lock(fd):
        ...  # exclusive region

``fd`` must be a file descriptor opened with write-access (e.g. from
``os.open(path, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT)``).
